Big Dream Ministries offers studies that help people learn more themselves through the Bible. 
These studies include 
* [The Amazing Collection: The Bible, Book by Book](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-collection/),
* [The Amazing Life of Jesus Christ](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-life-of-jesus-christ/),
* [Invincible Love, Invisible War](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/invincible-love-invisible-war/),
* [Be Amazing](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/be-amazing/),
* [The Amazing Temperaments](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-temperaments/), and
* [The Amazing Adventure](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/childrens-studies/).

These studies are sold in different packages; a set includes several DVDs and a workbook, a unit contains several sets, and a collection is the entire study. 
The broad question we answer in this project is: which customers will purchase new packages, and if they do, how many?
We arrive at an answer using so called Buy 'Til You Die (BTYD) models of customer likelihood of making future purchases, along with ensemble methods (logistic regression and decision trees) to determine which studies will be purchased.
