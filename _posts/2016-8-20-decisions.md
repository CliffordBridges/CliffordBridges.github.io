description: A tool to quickly formalize the decision making process

One day I was talking to a friend about the choice between two jobs. 
The usual process I follow when making decisions like this is:
<ol>
  <li>gather together all the features that seem important,</li>
  <li>determine just how important (relatively) each of those features are,</li>
  <li>rate each option I'm deciding between on each of those features,</li>
  <li>do some math and end up with number for each option.</li>
</ol>

Now, how much this number plays into my decision is depends on how I'm feeling that day, but in the very least I could formalize this process and make it interactive for anyone who likes to make decisions in this way!
