This is a jupyter notebook tag-a-long to my Medium article, ["Laplace Smoothing and the SunriseÂ Problem"](https://medium.com/p/1ac6a22449b9/edit). 
The notebook creates a visualization of how the Laplace smoothing probabilities change with <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\alpha$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\alpha$" title="$\alpha$" /></a>. 
Hopefully, the visualization explains why we say Laplace smoothing adjusts our probabilities towards a uniform distribution. 
But for those who prefer more rigor, I provide a proof as well!
