This project focused on developing recommendations for a technology company just entering the online-streaming business. 
In this project, we explored three key questions:
1) what genre of films make the most money, 
2) which actors/ directors are most successful, and 
3) how much should a company look to spend in advertising in order to maximize the profit from their investment.
