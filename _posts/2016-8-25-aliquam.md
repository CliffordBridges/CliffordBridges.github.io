We hope to provide a better means of classifying  what type of fit men's swimwear bottoms will provide a customer. 
The current standard is "board shorts" or "swim trunks", but these labels can fail describe a particular pair of swimwear accurately. 
We will use natural language processing on garment descriptions provided by e-commerce sites to more accurately classify the type of fit a garment will provide.
