My background is in theoretical mathematics, which has taught me invaluable skills in asking the right questions to get to a valuable answer. 
Now I am applying those skills in data science and machine learning! 
Check out a few of my projects hosted on Github ranging from fashion to instructional book sales. 
Contact me if you have any ideas about new directions to take these projects; I am excited to continue learning new skills.
